#What is Hey Day?
#Hey Day at Auburn University has been a tradition since 1947. Hey Day began after WWII soldiers were coming back from the war and people needed some help assimilating back into civilian life. Auburn encouraged students to wear name tags on Hey Day to meet people on campus that there normally would not have.
